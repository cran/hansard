# hansard 0.2.5

## Introducing the hansard package

Provides functions to download data from the data.parliament.uk APIs.

Because of the structure of the data.parliament.uk API, there is a named function for each type of available data for ease of use. Functions for each new API will be added as and when they become available on data.parliament.uk. See the package documentation for details on each function and the type of data available.
