An R package to automatically fetch data from the UK Parliament API.
Ironically, Hansard data (as in speeches) is not yet accessible through
the API. To explore all available data see
<http://www.data.parliament.uk/>. Documentation for the API itself is
available [here](http://explore.data.parliament.uk/).

Like the UK parliament API, this package is a work in progress.
Additional functionalities will be added to the package as they are
developed in the API. The most up-to-date documentation for this package
will always be available at <https://docs.evanodell.com/hansard/>.

To install from CRAN run:

    install.packages("hansard")

To install the development version run:

    #install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("evanodell/hansard")

## Using hansard

For an introduction to `hansard`, please see the
[vignette](https://docs.evanodell.com/hansard/articles/introduction.html).
If you are unfamiliar with web APIs [this introductory
course](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/) is useful.
