#' All answered parliamentary questions
#'
#' @description Imports data on all answered parliamentary questions in the
#' House of Commons and/or in the House of Lords. The `mp_id`,
#' `tabling_mp_id` and `answering_body` parameters accept a single
#' ID or department names, or a list of IDs or department names, respectively.
#'
#' @description This is the most flexible of the various functions that look
#' up questions, as it queries all types of questions in both houses with a
#' wide selection of parameters: The member who asks the question, the member
#' who answers it and the relevant department can all be used to query the API.
#' `mp_id`, `tabling_mp_id` and `answering_body` all accept
#' lists of multiple relevant search parameters. This can be in the form of a
#' list, a data.frame column, a character vector, etc.
#'
#' @param mp_id Accepts a member ID or vector of member IDs, and returns a
#' tibble with all available questions answered by that member. Includes both
#' oral and written questions, and includes members of the House of Commons
#' and the House of Lords. If `NULL`, returns a tibble with all available
#' answered questions, subject to other parameters. Defaults to `NULL`.
#'
#' @param tabling_mp_id Accepts a member ID or vector of member IDs, and
#' returns a tibble with all available questions asked by that member,
#' subject to all other parameters. Includes both oral and written questions,
#' and includes members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. If
#' `NULL`, returns a tibble with all available answered questions,
#' subject to other parameters. Defaults to `NULL`.
#'
#' @param house The house to return questions from. Accepts either the short
#' name of the legislature (e.g. `'commons'` or `'lords'`) or the
#' ID of the legislature (`1` for the House of Commons, `2` for the
#' House of Lords). The short names are not case sensitive.
#' If `NULL`, returns answers from both houses, subject to other
#' parameters. Defaults to `NULL`.
#'
#' @param answering_body The name of the government department that answers the
#' question, or a vector of government deparment names. Accepts either the
#' short name name of a department (e.g. `'Education'` for the Department
#' for Education, `'Digital, Culture, Media and Sport'` for the Department
#' for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport), or the ID of a particular department
#' (e.g. 60 for the Department for Education). If `NULL`, returns answers
#' from all departments, subject to other parameters. Defaults to `NULL`.
#'
#' @param start_date The earliest date to include in the tibble. Accepts
#' character values in `'YYYY-MM-DD'` format, and objects of class
#' `Date`, `POSIXt`, `POSIXct`, `POSIXlt` or anything else
#' that can be coerced to a date with `as.Date()`.
#' Defaults to `'1900-01-01'`.
#'
#' @param end_date The latest date to include in the tibble. Defaults to
#' `'1900-01-01'`. Accepts character values in `'YYYY-MM-DD'`
#' format, and objects of class `Date`, `POSIXt`, `POSIXct`,
#' `POSIXlt` or anything else that can be coerced to a date with
#' `as.Date()`. Defaults to the current system date.
#'
#' @param extra_args Additional parameters and queries to pass to API. These
#' queries must be strings and start with "&". See the
#' \href{http://explore.data.parliament.uk/}{API documentation}
#' or the package vignette for more details. Defaults to `NULL`.
#'
#' @param tidy Logical parameter. If `TRUE`, fixes the variable names
#' in the tibble to remove special characters and superfluous text, and
#' converts the variable names to a consistent style. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#'
#' @param tidy_style The style to convert variable names to, if
#' `tidy = TRUE`. Accepts one of `'snake_case'`, `'camelCase'`
#' and `'period.case'`. Defaults to `'snake_case'`.
#'
#' @param verbose If `TRUE`, displayes messages on the console on the
#' progress of the API request. Defaults to `TRUE`.
#'
#' @return A tibble with details on all answered questions in the House
#' of Commons and the House of Lords.
