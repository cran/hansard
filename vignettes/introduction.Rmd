`hansard` is an R package to pull data from the UK parliament through the <http://www.data.parliament.uk/> API. It emphasises simplicity and ease of use, so that users unfamiliar with APIs can easily retrieve large volumes of high quality data. Each function accepts a single argument at a time, and functions that require additional information to retrieve the data you requested will ask for it after you execute the function. Functions retrieve data in json format and convert it to a tibble. The `hansard_generic` function supports the building of API requests for XML, csv or HTML formats if required. Note that the API is rate limited to returning 5500 rows per request in some circumstances.

## Installing hansard

### From CRAN

```
install.packages("hansard")
```

### From GitHub (Development Version)

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EvanOdell/hansard")
```

### Load hansard

```
library(hansard)
```

## Using hansard

`hansard` contains functions for calling data for the UK Parliament API. The functions are designed to call data from a specific <http://www.data.parliament.uk/> API. The parameter options for each function vary, depending on the specific information available from each API, but there are four constant parameters in every function (with the exception of the `hansard_generic()` and `research_topics_list()` functions [described below](#special-functions)): `extra_args`,  `tidy`, `tidy_style` and `verbose`.

#### `extra_args`

The `extra_args` parameters allows additional arguments and queries to be passed to the API. This can include searching, limiting the parameters actually returned and ordering data. `extra_args` queries must follow the syntax used by the API, which requires an ampersand at the beginning of each argument e.g. `&_search=education`. Multiple arguments can be included, e.g. `&_search=education&_sort=title`. See the [http://explore.data.parliament.uk/](API documentation for more details.)

#### `tidy`

`tidy` is a logical parameter accepting either `TRUE` or `FALSE`, defaulting to `TRUE`. If `TRUE`, `hansard` will fix variable names, which by default contain non alpha-numeric characters and appear to use an inconsistent/idiosyncratic naming convention, at least by the standards of the various naming conventions used in R. Dates and datetimes are converted to POSIXct class. Some extra URL data included in the API is also stripped out.

#### `tidy_style`

The naming convention for variables used if `tidy==TRUE` is indicated by `tidy_style`. `tidy_style` accepts one of `"snake_case"`, `"camelCase"` and `"period.case"`, defaulting to `"snake_case"`. All variable names will be converted to match the given naming convention.

#### `verbose`

`verbose` is a logical parameter accepting either `TRUE` or `FALSE`, defaulting to `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, the function will print the progress of the API query to the console.

#### `hansard_` prefixes

In addition to the more generic sounding function names, each function in hansard has a wrapper where the name is prefixed with `hansard_`. For example, both `bills()` and `hansard_bills()` will return the same result.

Almost all `hansard` functions (the exceptions being the functions that retrieve more reference style data: `bill_stage_types()`, `commons_division_date()`, `commons_terms()` `constituencies()`, `election_candidates()`, `election_results()`, `members()`, `members_search()`, `research_briefings_lists()` and `hansard_generic()`) include a `start_date` and `end_date` parameter, which can be used to set the earliest (`start_date`) and latest (`end_date`) data to be returned from the API.



### Example using the `commons_divisions()` and `mp_vote_record()` functions

The `commons_divisions()` function returns divisions in the House of Commons, including the result of votes and information on what we being voted on. `mp_vote_record()` returns a data frame the voting record of a given MP on each division they voted in. The example below returns all Commons Divisions where Diane Abbott voted aye in 2017. To find the parliamentary ID of Diane Abbott (or any other member of the House of Commons or House of Lords), use the [`members_search()` function described below](#special-functions).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(hansard)
z <- mp_vote_record(172, "aye", start_date = "2017-01-01",
                    end_date = "2017-02-07", verbose = FALSE)
z
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(hansard)
library(tibble)
about <- c("685695", "685768", "685669", "685670", "685672", "678297",
           "678341", "677700", "671450", "670447", "670448")

         "CD:2017-02-06:205", "CD:2017-02-06:208", "CD:2017-01-25:199",
         "CD:2017-01-25:200", "CD:2017-01-24:196", "CD:2017-01-11:189",
         "CD:2017-01-10:184", "CD:2017-01-10:185")
date_value <- c("2017-02-07 GMT", "2017-02-07 GMT", "2017-02-06 GMT",
                "2017-02-06 GMT", "2017-02-06 GMT", "2017-01-25 GMT",
                "2017-01-25 GMT", "2017-01-24 GMT", "2017-01-11 GMT",
                "2017-01-10 GMT", "2017-01-10 GMT")
date_datatype <- c(rep ("POSIXct", 11))

z <- tibble::tibble(about, title, uin, date_value, date_datatype)
z
```


Using `commons_divisions()`, we can see the result of one of those votes, ID 722300, the Early Parliamentary General Election bill that dissolved parliament for the 2017 General Election. The function default is to return a list of every MP and how they voted:

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
x <- commons_divisions(722300, verbose = FALSE)
head(x)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(hansard)
library(tibble)

number <- c("1", "10", 100:103)
member_party <- c(rep("Labour", 3), "Labour (Co-op)", "Conservative", "Labour")
type <- c(rep("aye_vote", 6))
member_printed_value <- c("Ms Diane Abbott", "Dr Rosena Allin-Khan", 
                          "Mary Creagh", "Stella Creasy", "Tracey Crouch",
                          "Jon Cruddas")
vote_id <- c(rep("722300", 6))
about <- c("172", "4573", "1579", "4088", "3950", "1406")
label_value <- c("Biography information for Ms Diane Abbott",
                 "Biography information for Dr Rosena Allin-Khan",
                 "Biography information for Mary Creagh",
                 "Biography information for Stella Creasy",
                 "Biography information for Tracey Crouch",
                 "Biography information for Jon Cruddas")

x <- tibble::tibble(number, member_party, type, member_printed_value,
                    vote_id, about, label_value)
head(x)
```

With the `summary` parameter, we can return a brief summary table of votes:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
y <- commons_divisions(division_id = 722300, summary = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
tibble::glimpse(y)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
y <- tibble(abstain_count = "0", ayes_count = "522", noes_vote_count = "13",
            did_not_vote_count = "0", error_vote_count = "0", 
            non_eligible_count = "0", suspended_or_expelled_votes_count = "0",
            margin = "509", date = as.POSIXct("2017-04-19"),
            division_number = "196", session = "2016/17",
            title = "Early Parliamentary General Election", 
            uin = "CD:2017-04-19:264")
tibble::glimpse(y)
```


The results of votes in the House of Lords can be retrieved with the `lords_divisions` function. The voting record of individual Lords can  be retrieved using the `lords_vote_record` functions.

### Multiple Parameter Functions

The following functions accept vectors of member IDs and departmental names for applicable parameters:

* `all_answered_questions()`

* `commons_answered_questions()`

* `commons_oral_questions()`

* `commons_written_questions()`

* `lords_written_questions()`

* `mp_edms()`

For example, the following function returns all questions answered by Nichola Blackwood (4019) or Sam Gyimah (3980), asked by Keith Vaz (338) or Diane Abbot (172), and covered by the Department for Health or the Ministry of Justice, between 2016-12-18 and 2017-03-12.


```{r, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
w <- all_answered_questions(mp_id = c(4019, 3980), tabling_mp_id = c(338, 172),
                            answering_body = c("health", "justice"),
                            start_date = "2016-12-18", end_date = "2017-03-12")

tibble::glimpse(w) ## need to fix this

"The Government believes that prisons should be places of safety and reform. As part of this, reducing the incidence of suicide is a key priority. Our recent White Paper sets out the specific steps that we are taking to improve safety. They include investing over £100m to recruit an additional 2,500 staff across the estate by the end of 2018. The National Offender Management Service has launched a suicide and self-harm reduction project, led by an experienced prison governor, which is driving work in this area. This includes implementing the recommendations of a review of the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) process, the multi-disciplinary case management process that is the main tool for managing prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. Providing the right intervention and treatment is vital to improving the outcomes for people who are in distress, and all prisons have established procedures in place to identify, manage and support people at risk of suicide or self-harm. But we recognise that more can be done. That is why we have invested in specialist mental health training for prison officers and allocated more funding for prison safety. These improvements and reforms will benefit prisoners who are vulnerable, suffering from mental health problems or at risk of committing suicide.")

### Special functions

Several functions have special or experimental features:

* `research_briefings_lists()` An experimental feature that creates lists of possible parameters, and allows the user to call to the API based on the content of the list. Currently only available with the `research_briefings_lists` function.

* `hansard_generic()` A basic wrapper function for any of the available APIs. Users must specify the exact path they want the function to call from, and must also specify JSON formatting.

* `members_search()` A search function for members of the House of Commons and House of Lords.


### The `research_briefings()` function

The `research_briefings()` function includes the feature of requesting data using lists created using the `research_briefings_lists` functions:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
research_topics_list <- research_topics_list()

research_topics_list[[7]]
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
research_topics_list <- list("Agriculture, animals, food and rural affairs", 
     "Asylum, immigration and nationality", "Business, industry and consumers",
     "Communities and families", "Crime, civil law, justice and rights", 
     "Culture, media and sport", "Defence", "Economy and finance", "Education",
     "Employment and training", "Energy and environment", "European Union", 
     "Health services and medicine", "Housing and planning", 
     "International affairs", "Parliament, government and politics", 
     "Science and technology", "Social Security and pensions", 
     "Social services", "Transport")

research_topics_list[[7]]
```


In this case I have given them the same name as their function, but you can assign any name you wish to them.

Having created the lists, they can be used to specify which topics and subtopics to call, although strings can also be used. In the example below, `a` and `c` contain the same data.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
a <- research_briefings(topic = research_topics_list[[7]])

c <- research_briefings(topic = "Defence")
```

If a specific subtopic is called, but the topic is not specified, the function will still return all data within that specific subtopic. Note that this is slower than specifying the topic and subtopic.

If a specified subtopic is not a subtopic of the specified topic, the function will not return any data.

### The `hansard_generic()` function

The `hansard_generic()` function allows you to put in your own paths to the API. Information on all the paths available in the API can be found on the [DDP Explorer website](http://explore.data.parliament.uk/).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- hansard_generic("commonsansweredquestions.json")
```

Note that the API defaults to returning 10 items per page, but allows up to 500 items per page, the default used by `hansard`.
